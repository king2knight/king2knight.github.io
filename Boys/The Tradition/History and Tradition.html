<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Since 1937, McPherson
 High School has been playing basketball as a member of either the Central
Kansas League (CKL) or more recently the Ark Valley League (AVL) and Ark
Valley-Chisholm Trail League (AVCTL).  During the CKL years, the league name
stayed the same, but the league alignment changed eight times.  The </span><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>MHS League Affiliations Since 1937</span><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'> table illustrates the various league
changes and their respective durations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>While the league
alignment was changing over the years so was the game of basketball itself. 
What started out as a rather slow deliberate game has slowly evolved into the
up-tempo game we know today.  As the rules and coaching philosophies changed,
the game became faster resulting in increased scoring.  This can be seen from
the bar graph entitled </span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>Seasonal
Scoring Average by MHS Teams Since 1938</span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
color:black'>.  This graph illustrates changes in seasonal scoring averages
from 1938 to the present.  In the 1930's and during most of the 1940's, the
seasonal scoring average by MHS teams was less than 40 points per game.  In the
1950's, the scoring average climbed up into the 50 point per game range.  From
the 1960's on, the seasonal scoring averages have generally been in the 60
point per game range with a few seasons averaging more than 70 points per game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>As league
alignments and the game were gradually changing, there remained one constant, a
winning tradition.  This has been graphically illustrated in the bar chart
entitled </span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>Summary of McPherson's
Basketball Seasons 1938-2022.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Since 1938,
McPherson has enjoyed uncommon success on the basketball floor as evidenced by
an overall winning percentage of 76.0%.  What sustains such tradition year
after year?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Coaching:</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>With the
exception of Harold Johnston's 1 year stint, McPherson has had stability at the
position of head coach.  Jack Randle coached for 19 seasons, Jay Frazier for 26
seasons, Mike Henson for 12 seasons, and Kurt Kinnamon for 27 seasons and
counting. All of these coaches stressed teamwork and execution which enabled MHS
to beat more athletic teams regularly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Tradition:</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Tradition sets
the expectations high which is a great motivator.  Young players look up to
their high school heroes and aspire to be just like them someday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Teamwork:</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Teamwork
encompasses not only the way the players execute on the floor, but the way the
school, the parents, and community at large support the program.  The tradition
is alive and well thanks to the dedication of the coaches, players, parents,
fans, and the community.  Perhaps the winning tradition started back with the
success of the Globe Refiners in the mid 1930's.  Whatever the origin,
McPherson has long been known as a basketball town.</span></p>
