<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;color:black'>Since 1938, McPherson
 High School has made it to the state tournament 47 times or an equivalent to
an average appearance greater than every other year.  Frequent appearances at
the state tournament over the years have created a community following
unrivaled by any other school.  With the overwhelming support of the fans, the
Bullpups have played well at the state tournament.  Their resume includes 13
state championships, 26 championship title games, and an overall winning percentage
of 67.5%.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;color:black'>Despite these
successes, it could be argued that more state championships would have been won
had the classification system always been as we know it today.  For example, on
three occasions, 1961, 1965, and 1967, state championship caliber teams were
defeated in the state tournament by Wyandotte High School.  This huge Kansas
  City school had a virtual dynasty on state championships (10 in 14 years from
1956-69).  Wyandotte may have been the only team capable of defeating McPherson
those three seasons.  In today’s classification system, McPherson would have
not been a large enough school to play Wyandotte during their dynasty years.</span></p>
