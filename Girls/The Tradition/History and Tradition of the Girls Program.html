<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:28.0pt;color:red'>History and Tradition</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Since 1969-70
season, McPherson High School has been playing girls basketball first as an
independent, and then in 1978 as member of the Ark Valley League (AVL) and later
the Ark Valley-Chisholm Trail League (AVCTL).  During the AVCTL years, the
league name stayed the same, but the league alignment changed 8 times.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>While the league
alignment was changing over the years so was the game of basketball itself. 
What started out as a rather slow deliberate game has slowly evolved into a
more up-tempo game. As the rules, coaching philosophies, and the players' skill
sets improved, the game became faster which resulted in increased scoring. 
This can be seen from the bar graph entitled </span><span style='font-size:
18.0pt;color:red'>Seasonal Scoring Average by MHS Teams Since 1970</span><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>.  This graph illustrates changes in
seasonal scoring averages from 1970 to the present.  In the 1970's, the per
game scoring average by MHS teams was in the 40's.  Starting the 1980's and
moving forward, the per game scoring average climbed up into the 50+ points per
game range.  In certain years, the per game scoring average increased into the
60's. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>As league
alignments, and the game itself, were gradually changing, there remained one
constant, a winning tradition.  This has been graphically illustrated in the
bar chart entitled </span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>Summary of
McPherson's Basketball Seasons 1969-2024.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Since 1970,
McPherson has enjoyed uncommon success on the basketball floor as evidenced by
an overall winning percentage of 77.1%.  What sustains such tradition year
after year?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Coaching:</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>For the first 20
years, McPherson had relatively short tenures at the position of head coach.  Ann
Killingsworth coached for 5 seasons, Mike Fitzwater for 2 seasons, John Hoffman
for 7 seasons, Brian Cordel for 3 seasons, and Nancy Loescher for 6 seasons. 
Starting in 1992, the coaching position has been stable. Scott Schaefer coached
for 13 seasons, and his assistant, Chris Strathman has been at the helm for 19
years and counting.  All of these coaches stressed teamwork and execution which
enabled MHS to regularly beat more athletic teams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Tradition:</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Tradition sets
the expectations high at MHS which is a great motivator.  Young players look up
to their high school heroes and aspire to be just like them someday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Teamwork:</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Teamwork
encompasses not only the way the players execute on the floor, but the way the
school, the parents, and community at large support the program.  The tradition
is alive and well thanks to the dedication of the coaches, players, parents,
fans, and the community.  Perhaps the boys' winning tradition rubbed off on the
girls' program.  Whatever the reason, McPherson has been rightly known a
basketball town.</span></p>
