<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>The following
collection of records, streaks, rosters, tables, and graphs was primarily
derived from seasonal summaries prepared and turned in to the KSHSAA by the
athletic department at McPherson High School.  This particular study starts with
the 1937-38 season for the boys and with the 1969-70 season for the girls. 
Although boys basketball was played prior to 1937, the high school's records
only go back to the 1937-38 season.  Regardless, this was a natural place to
start the study since it represented the start of Coach Jack Randle's career as
head basketball coach, and it lines up closely to the records compiled by the
KSHSAA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>In order to
extract all the statistical information found in this study, originally over 1200
individual basketball games had to be entered into the computer by hand.  For
each game, the following fields were entered into the relational database:  <b>Date,
Venue, Situation, Opposing Team, McPherson's Score, Opponent's Score, and the
Point Difference.</b>  In addition to the high school's seasonal summaries,
information was researched via microfilm from <i>The McPherson Daily Republican</i>
and <i>The McPherson Sentinel</i> to ensure accuracy and completeness.  Once
all the games were entered into the computer, the database could be queried to
obtain specific statistics of interest.  The type of statistics chosen for this
study were patterned after university basketball media guides. Other statistics
were derived because they were of specific interest to the inquiring minds of
McPherson's basketball fans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Although this
study involved hundreds of hours of work to assemble, it pales in comparison to
all the hours the coaches and players invested in practice in order to achieve
the consistent level of success seen over the years.  Besides the dedication of
the players and coaches, the loyal support of the McPherson Bullpup fans has
had a positive effect.  Through the collective teamwork of the coaches,
players, and fans, McPherson High School basketball has provided thousands of
spectators with quality basketball season after season.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Quality
basketball year after year is a luxury few schools enjoy.  McPherson is
fortunate to have a sustained, rich heritage in basketball unlike any other
school in the state.  As such, it is important for McPherson Bullpup fans to
understand just how far back our basketball tradition goes. Having an
understanding for the scope of our basketball heritage will only enhance the
enjoyment and pride McPhersonites feel for their teams year after year. 
Hopefully, the following collection of statistics about MHS basketball will
heighten ones appreciation of the tradition known as <b>McPherson Bullpup
Basketball</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:black'>Now, immerse
yourself in the statistics to follow.  As you study and analyze the
information, you will begin to see and appreciate the magnitude of the
accomplishments our players and coaches have made over the years.</span></p>
