###Remove Rainbow Screen###
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Then add below line at the end of the file.

disable_splash=1
 

###Remove text message under splash image:###
Open “/usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/pix.script” as root.

sudo nano /usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/pix.script
Then, remove (or comment out) four lines below:

message_sprite = Sprite();
message_sprite.SetPosition(screen_width * 0.1, screen_height * 0.9, 10000);
my_image = Image.Text(text, 1, 1, 1);
message_sprite.SetImage(my_image);



###Remove Boot Messages###

sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
Then, replace “console=tty1” with “console=tty3”. This redirects boot messages to tty3.

Remove other things
Still in “/boot/cmdline.txt”, add below at the end of the line


splash quiet plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles logo.nologo vt.global_cursor_default=0
Here are brief explanations.
‘splash’ : enables splash image
‘quiet’ : disable boot message texts
‘plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles’ : not sure about this but seems it’s required when use Plymouth.
‘logo.nologo’ : removes Raspberry Pi logo in top left corner.
‘vt.global_cursor_default=0’ : removes blinking cursor.

Note : The first three should be there by default, but make sure if those exist.

 

###Replace Splash Image###
Now, everything unwanted images and texts are gone. Let’s replace the default splash image (/usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png) with your own splash image.

sudo cp ~/my_splash.png /usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png
Note : As described in above assumption, “my_splash.png” should be your new splash image.
